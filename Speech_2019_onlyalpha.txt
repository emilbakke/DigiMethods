prime
minister
mette
frederiksen
opening
address
at
the
opening
of
the
folketing
the
danish
parliament
the
spoken
word
applies
the
pram
standing
outside
brugsen
with
the
child
in
it
the
strawberry
booth
on
the
roadside
where
the
box
for
money
is
standing
unguarded
the
children
riding
their
bicycles
to
school
i
feeling
a
bit
like
dan
turèll
jeg
holder
af
hverdagen
i
fond
of
everyday
life
because
it
the
little
things
that
make
up
the
sum
of
our
grand
history
everyday
life
past
and
present
in
a
single
word
trust
when
you
ask
danes
if
we
trust
other
people
a
record
amount
of
people
answer
yes
in
denmark
we
don
have
gold
mines
but
we
have
something
even
more
valuable
we
have
trust
in
each
other
we
have
built
a
society
based
on
trust
with
duties
and
rights
in
that
order
i
pay
my
taxes
trusting
that
you
pay
yours
i
pay
towards
your
medical
appointment
trusting
that
you
pay
towards
mine
we
have
that
solidarity
and
when
we
meet
in
our
neighbourhood
in
the
workplace
at
the
parent
meeting
human
to
human
we
are
being
met
with
trust
it
is
not
just
cozy
it
is
a
huge
strength
just
one
example
if
the
engineer
in
a
danish
company
has
made
a
drawing
from
which
the
smith
can
deduct
that
it
does
not
completely
align
with
the
actual
conditions
then
the
smith
approaches
the
engineer
and
says
listen
there
just
that
one
detail
there
don
you
think
it
ought
to
be
a
little
different
because
they
know
each
other
they
attended
school
together
they
play
oldboys
soccer
each
sunday
denmark
is
connected
there
is
that
trust
closeness
mutual
respect
it
provides
stability
creativity
jobs
progress
trust
does
not
only
make
us
safe
but
also
rich
denmark
is
a
fantastic
country
do
you
recognize
the
picture
of
denmark
i
just
painted
i
believe
so
or
maybe
you
can
remember
it
but
there
might
someone
who
thinks
is
everything
really
as
rosy
as
that
i
wish
i
could
answer
yes
but
no
i
cannot
because
even
though
the
frame
around
the
picture
is
stable
the
painting
has
faded
somewhat
the
strawberry
booth
now
has
video
surveillance
and
it
is
a
paradox
that
even
though
the
overall
wealth
has
improved
many
are
sensing
a
greater
insecurity
when
you
ask
the
danes
today
do
you
think
that
your
children
will
have
a
better
future
than
the
one
you
had
many
are
in
doubt
those
who
have
toiled
for
a
long
time
in
physically
demanding
jobs
are
worried
about
the
near
future
they
experience
that
the
welfare
society
they
paid
towards
their
entire
working
life
is
not
there
when
they
need
it
i
will
do
everything
i
can
to
carry
through
a
new
right
to
early
retirement
for
the
most
worn
out
in
the
workforce
we
must
keep
fighting
for
justice
history
does
not
only
move
forward
it
can
regress
as
well
in
the
wider
world
battles
we
thought
were
won
are
being
lost
free
trade
freedoms
women
free
right
to
abortion
and
at
home
in
denmark
i
know
many
people
who
see
that
things
are
on
the
move
only
they
not
themselves
part
of
the
development
running
faster
but
never
fast
enough
new
demands
there
are
cracks
in
the
trust
centralization
the
scandal
in
skat
an
american
capital
fund
buying
our
homes
a
bonus
of
several
hundred
million
kroners
to
a
ceo
does
greed
know
of
no
boundaries
apparently
not
large
banks
who
failed
their
responsibilities
towards
the
society
even
though
we
helped
them
the
climate
crisis
a
worry
for
our
globe
and
our
existence
denmark
is
a
strong
country
the
danes
are
skilful
our
businesses
take
on
responsibility
for
the
society
of
which
they
are
a
part
and
for
the
jobs
and
the
welfare
upon
which
our
society
is
based
there
is
unrest
in
the
world
countries
close
to
us
are
heading
for
weaker
growth
and
both
brexit
and
trade
wars
can
affect
us
as
well
but
within
denmark
there
is
still
progress
employment
is
high
unemployment
numbers
are
low
a
lot
is
going
really
well
actually
most
things
are
going
well
but
if
it
shall
continue
to
go
well
then
we
must
do
something
about
the
things
which
are
not
going
well
the
differences
have
become
too
big
the
society
contract
has
become
weaker
the
trust
has
decreased
if
the
feeling
of
powerlessness
grabs
hold
of
us
we
risk
losing
our
faith
in
democracy
the
will
to
find
unity
hope
for
change
we
must
never
lose
that
because
then
we
also
lose
faith
in
our
ability
to
create
a
future
together
therefore
we
must
strengthen
that
which
makes
denmark
into
denmark
the
trust
the
unity
the
solidarity
those
are
the
values
i
been
aiming
for
since
i
was
young
and
even
though
i
grown
older
and
in
some
aspects
wiser
hopefully
this
happens
throughout
one
life
i
will
stick
to
what
i
came
from
i
will
lead
the
country
with
a
clear
ambition
for
denmark
therefore
my
speech
today
is
not
a
litany
of
all
the
many
things
which
the
government
plans
to
carry
through
over
the
course
of
the
working
year
of
the
folketing
these
things
are
written
down
in
the
legislative
program
instead
i
will
point
out
a
direction
greater
justice
welfare
first
a
greener
denmark
today
i
would
like
to
say
thank
you
for
the
trust
that
is
being
put
in
the
new
government
that
is
being
shown
me
as
the
new
prime
minister
by
the
voters
and
by
our
parliamentary
support
enhedslisten
the
red
alliance
sf
the
socialist
peoples
party
de
radikale
the
social
liberal
party
we
have
written
a
paper
of
common
understanding
which
we
can
be
proud
of
i
am
proud
of
it
i
look
forward
to
the
cooperation
with
you
all
i
look
forward
to
the
cooperation
with
everyone
here
at
the
folketing
the
government
does
not
have
all
the
necessary
mandates
ourselves
for
everything
that
we
wish
to
achieve
i
believe
that
broad
agreements
can
provide
better
results
on
other
occasions
there
is
a
price
to
pay
for
a
compromise
we
will
be
honest
about
that
today
i
am
holding
my
first
opening
address
as
prime
minister
many
of
you
here
in
the
parliament
60
of
you
to
be
precise
are
about
to
start
your
first
working
year
at
the
folketing
also
we
have
a
new
party
with
us
from
colleague
to
colleague
i
say
welcome
shouldn
we
new
as
well
as
old
mps
steer
towards
the
common
ambition
to
be
the
best
version
of
the
folketing
in
the
new
working
year
because
even
though
the
trust
in
us
politicians
has
improved
a
bit
it
is
still
quite
low
and
i
see
the
lack
of
trust
as
a
wake
call
i
think
it
may
have
to
do
with
the
fact
that
we
sometimes
how
shall
i
put
it
tend
to
inflate
our
results
somewhat
that
we
not
always
being
completely
honest
pretending
that
something
which
is
difficult
or
hard
is
actually
easy
or
the
other
way
around
i
will
try
to
steer
clear
of
that
the
general
population
has
far
more
trust
in
other
groups
in
our
society
midwives
police
nurses
doctors
everyone
working
with
caretaking
of
other
people
i
understand
that
today
i
will
say
to
all
of
you
you
create
the
safety
and
the
opportunities
which
make
denmark
into
denmark
every
day
you
work
little
miracles
it
cannot
get
more
important
and
yet
you
are
being
put
under
pressure
year
after
year
but
it
shouldn
be
so
that
even
though
the
society
grows
richer
the
welfare
is
decreasing
the
government
will
put
welfare
first
let
us
get
rid
of
the
reprioritization
contributions
on
education
all
the
way
from
amu
courses
labour
market
courses
further
education
over
vocational
training
to
universities
and
in
the
agreements
we
have
made
with
the
regions
and
the
municipalities
we
put
a
floor
under
the
welfare
so
that
more
social
and
healthcare
and
social
and
healthcare
can
be
hired
when
there
are
more
elderly
so
that
more
children
means
more
adults
as
well
so
that
the
money
follows
the
demographics
the
welfare
has
been
worn
too
thin
in
some
places
and
in
some
places
it
takes
too
much
of
a
toll
on
the
employees
therefore
we
will
set
aside
money
for
an
additional
1000
nurses
in
other
words
we
begin
to
expand
the
welfare
i
could
go
on
like
that
speaking
of
what
the
government
is
doing
i
could
adorn
my
speaking
with
words
of
praise
for
our
politics
i
believe
you
can
almost
finish
my
sentences
for
me
we
all
know
the
lingo
the
many
billions
for
ten
years
municipalities
and
regions
have
not
had
that
much
money
for
children
sick
people
and
for
the
elderly
i
could
say
that
actually
i
have
just
said
it
but
i
want
to
say
something
else
as
well
i
want
to
say
it
like
it
is
some
of
you
sitting
on
the
benches
here
in
the
hall
or
watching
this
at
home
you
will
not
notice
the
changes
right
away
everyday
life
in
the
hospitals
the
nursing
homes
and
in
day
care
will
not
be
noticeably
more
safe
or
better
not
to
begin
with
anyway
even
though
we
spend
several
billions
even
though
we
roll
back
unevenly
distributed
tax
cuts
even
though
we
start
spending
the
money
on
education
children
and
health
the
challenges
are
still
so
big
that
many
will
not
even
notice
in
other
words
i
will
give
you
the
honest
version
we
only
just
taken
the
first
step
and
the
road
is
long
but
the
first
step
means
that
we
are
on
our
way
step
by
step
agreement
by
agreement
budget
by
budget
year
by
year
we
will
put
welfare
first
when
distributing
the
money
but
it
is
also
clear
as
day
that
money
does
not
solve
all
the
problems
we
must
also
engage
in
a
more
fundamental
debate
about
the
welfare
society
why
did
we
create
it
why
did
we
build
this
unique
fantastic
society
the
welfare
society
was
built
by
people
for
people
that
how
it
was
it
is
that
simple
and
that
fine
but
today
it
can
sometimes
feel
as
though
the
welfare
has
been
forced
back
into
the
background
and
something
else
has
taken
over
new
public
management
budget
cuts
streamlining
as
long
as
i
can
remember
danish
politics
have
ultimately
been
about
a
welfare
society
which
was
again
and
again
to
accomplish
more
with
less
also
a
strange
development
has
emerged
which
we
may
laugh
at
but
which
i
actually
think
might
be
a
part
of
the
problem
when
i
looked
at
my
daughter
new
timetable
in
august
i
didn
understand
the
acronyms
a
teachers
training
collage
lærerseminarium
has
now
become
a
university
college
and
do
you
know
for
example
what
plc
stands
for
no
right
it
stands
for
pedagogical
learning
center
it
used
to
be
called
a
school
library
why
did
we
stop
calling
things
by
their
actual
name
it
is
a
completely
unnecessary
alienation
of
course
we
have
to
improve
things
wherever
necessary
and
it
may
be
necessary
to
conduct
meetings
even
to
lay
out
strategies
but
welfare
is
not
a
project
welfare
is
warmth
well
love
and
care
possibilities
we
are
many
who
can
thank
the
welfare
society
for
giving
us
the
opportunity
to
rise
through
the
ranks
of
society
but
the
social
mobility
is
no
longer
improving
and
in
many
places
the
everyday
welfare
has
become
worse
we
now
have
more
project
welfare
less
of
the
plain
care
let
me
give
you
an
example
the
police
more
and
more
citizens
experience
that
the
police
does
not
respond
or
that
their
cases
are
prolonged
we
should
be
able
to
put
our
trust
in
the
police
and
the
judicial
system
anything
else
is
frightening
what
has
happened
new
tasks
have
been
added
banditry
terrorism
bombings
border
control
but
is
that
the
whole
explanation
or
has
pseudo
been
allowed
to
take
time
from
real
work
as
well
today
the
danish
national
police
has
over
1900
employees
that
is
twice
the
amount
of
the
employees
in
the
police
force
of
funen
many
are
employed
in
the
central
administration
units
instead
of
close
to
the
citizens
can
we
find
a
better
balance
the
police
is
one
example
here
another
example
caring
for
the
elderly
i
been
through
an
internship
as
a
home
carer
we
were
handed
a
timetable
with
precise
minutes
every
visit
to
an
elderly
citizen
was
measured
out
to
a
certain
number
of
minutes
but
you
cannot
just
say
to
a
citizen
who
is
sad
you
can
only
be
sad
for
8
minutes
today
it
makes
no
sense
someone
spent
time
figuring
out
those
timetables
somebody
spends
time
controlling
them
i
would
not
even
be
surprised
if
people
spend
time
controlling
the
work
of
the
person
controlling
them
meanwhile
an
old
man
lies
in
bed
waiting
for
help
to
get
out
of
bed
employees
in
the
care
sector
for
the
elderly
spend
half
their
time
at
work
with
the
elderly
the
other
half
is
spent
on
documentation
meetings
preparation
of
medicine
transport
from
one
citizen
to
another
etc
of
course
the
medication
need
to
be
prepared
and
the
day
shift
needs
to
be
informed
of
what
happened
during
the
night
shift
but
are
there
other
task
we
can
do
without
and
which
ones
here
is
where
we
enter
into
a
territory
filled
with
dilemmas
here
is
where
it
becomes
really
difficult
take
for
instance
the
right
to
free
choice
paradigm
an
excellent
idea
but
when
the
citizen
shall
have
the
opportunity
to
choose
cleaning
services
for
instance
from
a
private
company
the
task
cleaning
must
be
clearly
specified
a
certain
number
of
minutes
to
vacuum
the
question
is
if
a
part
of
the
minute
tyranny
in
the
elderly
care
has
emerged
because
of
the
inclusion
of
private
companies
and
the
right
to
freely
choose
your
supplier
of
services
and
now
don
be
fooled
into
thinking
that
i
only
going
after
the
holy
cows
of
the
centre
here
comes
the
next
dilemma
what
is
more
important
time
for
care
and
attention
or
documentation
and
rights
i
think
that
most
of
us
here
in
the
folketing
at
some
point
have
demanded
new
rights
for
the
citizen
perhaps
mostly
those
of
us
on
the
left
wing
we
all
touched
by
the
story
of
the
elderly
lady
with
nobody
to
help
her
with
the
cleaning
tasks
but
is
it
not
the
plain
truth
that
we
are
tempted
to
legislate
and
regulate
to
such
an
extent
that
the
judgement
which
lies
with
the
proud
care
taker
the
proud
local
politician
is
no
longer
being
taken
into
consideration
is
it
gradually
beginning
to
be
only
in
festive
speeches
that
we
praise
the
local
democracy
do
we
actually
want
to
let
the
municipal
autonomy
decide
and
are
the
most
important
issues
always
focused
upon
in
the
municipalities
welfare
for
the
citizen
not
timetables
and
strategies
the
social
democrats
used
to
have
it
as
a
part
of
our
policy
to
campaign
for
elderly
citizen
right
to
have
a
daily
shower
we
did
not
succeed
in
carrying
that
through
luckily
just
think
of
what
it
would
have
brought
along
the
amounts
of
controlling
and
the
amounts
of
timetables
besides
some
of
the
elderly
citizens
said
that
they
really
didn
want
to
have
a
shower
every
single
day
this
produced
some
headlines
do
you
remember
commentaries
from
nursing
homes
where
residents
stated
that
it
was
completely
unnecessary
to
take
all
these
showers
we
had
forgotten
to
ask
the
elderly
citizens
what
they
would
like
the
most
and
equally
important
we
forgot
what
politics
is
actually
about
legislation
should
be
about
direction
that
is
the
way
to
lead
a
country
that
is
the
political
responsibility
if
there
is
an
actual
problem
in
a
nursing
home
then
the
head
of
the
nursing
home
must
solve
the
problem
and
the
employee
must
be
held
accountable
instead
we
are
now
in
the
process
of
draining
the
best
society
model
in
the
world
of
the
most
important
elements
the
trust
in
knowing
that
other
people
do
their
jobs
the
trust
in
the
fact
that
problems
can
be
solved
on
a
local
level
and
that
mistakes
can
be
corrected
if
we
are
to
turn
that
development
around
it
will
demand
something
from
all
of
us
and
hang
on
tight
it
will
become
difficult
because
we
will
not
only
have
to
legislate
all
over
again
we
are
going
to
have
to
let
go
we
must
all
ask
ourselves
the
tough
questions
in
the
municipalities
how
can
we
go
about
making
fewer
timetables
and
strategies
in
the
labour
unions
how
can
we
make
ourselves
stop
demanding
firm
rules
for
our
members
all
the
time
in
the
patient
associations
how
do
we
keep
ourselves
from
demanding
new
rights
in
the
parent
councils
they
must
try
to
control
themselves
and
not
add
a
sugar
policy
onto
the
existing
ecology
policy
and
here
in
the
folketing
we
must
become
better
at
not
sticking
our
noses
in
everything
even
if
mistakes
have
been
made
we
must
abstain
from
legislating
based
on
a
case
case
approach
because
you
know
what
the
employees
are
drowning
in
all
the
good
intentions
as
to
how
they
do
their
job
in
the
best
possible
way
i
can
understand
those
who
let
the
bureaucracy
enter
the
one
ear
and
disappear
out
of
the
other
and
spend
their
energy
on
being
with
the
citizens
we
need
a
closeness
reform
where
we
reduce
the
micro
from
above
and
power
up
the
professionalism
and
the
leadership
in
the
municipal
institutions
we
will
not
compromise
on
the
results
cancer
treatment
must
continue
to
improve
the
children
must
still
learn
more
in
school
the
point
is
quite
to
the
contrary
that
the
governance
and
leadership
we
have
today
does
not
provide
the
best
results
we
can
and
must
do
better
today
i
would
like
to
invite
all
of
you
to
join
me
on
a
journey
there
are
no
free
passes
the
journey
will
demand
something
from
all
of
us
it
will
not
be
easy
but
it
can
be
good
very
good
if
we
dare
trust
in
that
the
welfare
is
there
for
those
who
need
it
time
for
care
human
to
human
we
must
put
efforts
into
all
the
areas
where
mistrust
has
replaced
trust
our
tax
authorities
it
is
not
only
an
it
which
has
failed
it
is
not
only
some
crooks
who
have
stolen
money
out
of
the
common
treasury
it
is
the
completely
fundamental
trust
in
the
fact
that
the
community
works
many
years
of
rebuilding
lie
ahead
it
has
been
said
before
it
will
become
difficult
that
has
also
been
said
before
but
the
task
is
there
we
must
take
it
on
together
tax
evasion
must
be
uncovered
and
punished
this
demands
that
the
controlling
is
sufficient
tomorrow
we
will
publish
the
government
budget
proposal
in
it
we
intend
to
add
more
money
to
the
tax
authorities
for
it
among
other
things
i
wonder
if
some
of
you
watching
today
are
sporting
a
slightly
blank
stare
when
people
start
speaking
of
the
tax
authorities
and
it
i
can
recognise
the
feeling
myself
the
employees
in
the
tax
authorities
do
what
they
can
they
do
it
as
well
as
they
can
they
deserve
new
colleagues
therefore
we
will
employ
more
people
like
in
the
good
old
days
real
humans
who
can
make
sure
that
everyone
pays
the
taxes
they
are
supposed
to
pay
there
is
one
place
in
our
society
where
the
crisis
of
trust
has
been
bigger
than
anywhere
else
immigration
policy
for
decades
it
was
as
if
the
politicians
at
christiansborg
and
the
population
were
living
in
separate
worlds
i
know
because
i
myself
was
far
too
late
in
understanding
how
bad
it
was
failed
integration
has
left
traces
in
schools
in
residential
areas
in
workplaces
and
perhaps
most
evidently
in
the
crime
statistics
in
prisons
four
out
of
ten
do
not
have
a
danish
background
far
too
many
of
those
who
have
come
here
commit
crimes
or
their
sons
do
crimes
of
violence
are
more
than
three
times
as
often
carried
out
by
male
descendants
of
immigrants
with
a
non
background
than
by
other
men
crime
is
an
evil
in
itself
there
are
places
where
i
too
feel
unsafe
at
night
on
top
of
that
a
few
do
a
lot
of
damage
for
the
many
for
all
those
with
a
foreign
background
who
live
a
law
life
contribute
to
the
society
and
yet
they
risk
being
held
accountable
for
the
atrocities
of
others
and
regardless
of
who
commits
violence
and
crime
danes
or
foreigners
the
danish
society
is
at
risk
of
becoming
more
brutalized
i
can
sense
that
we
are
beginning
to
get
used
to
it
reckless
driving
threats
stabbings
shootings
gang
showdowns
explosions
that
slowly
we
accept
having
to
find
a
different
route
when
walking
home
at
night
that
it
just
becomes
a
trivial
part
of
the
news
stream
that
we
just
scroll
on
shrugging
our
shoulders
it
cannot
come
to
that
that
is
not
the
denmark
i
want
we
cannot
fight
for
cohesion
and
equal
opportunities
without
taking
integration
very
seriously
and
we
cannot
take
integration
seriously
without
saying
the
number
of
immigrants
has
a
significance
i
do
know
that
things
are
not
simple
that
life
is
complicated
that
behind
the
statistics
there
are
real
people
and
their
stories
but
i
will
also
say
when
you
come
to
denmark
you
are
given
the
chance
to
live
in
a
country
with
access
to
free
education
you
get
free
healthcare
you
get
a
chhance
for
a
job
and
you
live
in
peace
then
it
comes
with
the
responsibility
to
make
use
of
these
possibilities
if
you
do
not
do
that
then
it
is
a
breach
of
trust
the
government
is
prepared
to
go
to
great
lengths
with
regards
to
those
who
do
not
want
to
join
the
community
and
who
do
not
wish
denmark
well
i
will
say
quite
clearly
to
the
population
you
can
trust
that
i
will
lead
the
restrictive
immigration
policy
backed
by
the
majority
and
we
need
to
go
even
further
the
government
wants
to
take
a
look
at
how
we
can
create
a
tighter
legislation
with
regards
to
reckless
driving
syria
warriors
banditry
and
those
who
have
been
rejected
for
asylum
must
go
home
immigration
policy
must
be
restrictive
but
don
get
me
wrong
the
tightenings
must
target
the
right
individuals
it
is
not
a
loosening
of
immigration
policies
when
mint
is
given
a
second
chance
or
that
the
children
at
sjælsmark
can
take
their
food
to
their
family
rooms
it
does
not
go
against
firm
demands
towards
integration
to
recognize
those
who
have
done
well
on
the
contrary
thousands
of
people
have
come
here
from
other
countries
they
have
learned
danish
gone
to
school
educated
themselves
they
go
to
work
and
share
our
values
i
want
to
say
to
all
of
you
you
are
a
part
of
our
society
you
contribute
to
the
community
and
of
course
you
should
be
able
to
trust
that
denmark
is
your
country
too
i
am
prime
minister
for
all
of
denmark
i
will
hold
on
to
what
unites
us
trust
responsibility
justice
strengthen
the
most
precious
assets
we
have
our
welfare
our
fellowship
and
i
will
remember
the
world
history
of
which
we
are
a
part
next
year
we
commemorate
two
important
anniversaries
they
will
be
celebrated
we
must
learn
from
history
on
the
5th
of
may
2020
it
will
have
been
75
years
since
denmark
was
liberated
many
of
the
witnesses
from
world
war
ll
are
no
longer
with
us
fewer
are
left
to
tell
us
about
what
it
was
like
a
europe
which
lifted
itself
up
from
the
ground
following
war
despair
and
genocide
built
peace
upon
international
rules
cooperation
trust
between
countries
we
must
carry
forward
that
torch
next
year
we
will
also
celebrate
the
100th
anniversary
of
the
reunification
of
south
jutland
with
denmark
not
by
the
means
of
war
and
violence
but
via
a
peaceful
referendum
through
trust
the
same
trust
which
is
also
the
source
of
great
cooperation
in
the
border
region
an
international
role
model
the
same
trust
which
is
the
foundation
upon
which
we
have
built
the
good
and
solid
relations
we
have
with
germany
and
also
the
trust
upon
which
the
european
cooperation
is
built
if
we
had
any
doubts
then
just
look
at
great
britain
i
want
to
make
political
changes
in
a
europe
which
provide
solutions
to
the
problems
of
our
time
a
mobility
which
is
in
some
places
better
for
the
market
than
for
the
workers
tax
evasions
in
the
scale
of
billions
because
the
speculators
are
always
one
step
ahead
of
the
common
rules
the
climate
which
can
only
be
solved
together
with
other
countries
and
the
concern
as
to
whether
or
not
europe
has
its
borders
under
control
europe
does
not
traffickers
make
their
living
from
the
misery
of
others
refugees
are
drowning
in
the
mediterranean
sea
our
government
wishes
to
help
people
who
are
fleeing
war
and
violence
help
in
the
regions
of
origin
this
is
where
we
can
help
the
most
i
wish
to
lead
the
work
on
a
new
asylum
system
more
just
more
humane
i
will
bring
that
message
with
me
to
brussels
and
refugees
who
come
to
denmark
and
are
granted
asylum
must
return
to
their
home
country
and
help
rebuilding
it
as
soon
as
it
is
possible
this
provides
space
so
that
we
can
help
the
refugees
of
the
future
the
government
wants
to
take
the
danish
european
policy
into
a
new
and
progressive
direction
because
if
we
do
not
succeed
in
doing
so
we
risk
that
the
trust
in
international
cooperation
disappears
the
cooperation
built
in
order
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
the
horrors
of
the
world
war
and
which
is
equally
important
today
as
it
was
then
there
are
so
many
looking
to
spread
dissent
in
a
world
which
is
torn
we
shall
unify
the
climate
changes
and
the
interest
in
the
arctic
draw
greenland
and
the
faroe
islands
closer
to
the
centre
of
the
global
stage
i
understand
the
wish
of
the
faroe
islands
and
greenland
to
be
more
involved
in
the
foreign
and
security
policy
i
do
agree
that
we
should
strengthen
the
cooperation
share
knowledge
and
information
we
are
three
countries
three
peoples
three
cultures
but
we
also
have
a
strong
community
i
would
like
to
extend
an
open
invitation
to
cooperate
in
areas
where
it
can
be
of
mutual
benefit
as
well
as
i
would
like
to
say
to
the
north
atlantic
mps
here
in
the
folketing
that
the
government
will
prioritize
the
cooperation
with
and
the
involvement
of
you
the
faroe
islands
have
held
a
parliamentary
election
a
new
government
has
been
formed
the
prime
minister
of
the
faroe
islands
bárður
á
steig
nielsen
and
i
have
agreed
that
i
will
be
visiting
the
faroe
islands
soon
in
order
for
us
to
get
our
cooperation
initiated
i
look
forward
to
that
one
of
the
first
things
i
did
when
i
became
prime
minister
was
to
visit
greenland
in
august
the
premier
of
naalakkersuisut
kim
kielsen
and
i
have
already
begun
our
cooperation
regarding
a
topic
which
deeply
affects
both
of
us
the
children
of
greenland
i
see
a
new
willingness
to
talk
about
the
problems
also
the
difficult
problems
suicide
abuse
violations
greenland
has
asked
denmark
to
enter
into
a
closer
cooperation
regarding
the
children
i
have
said
yes
to
that
of
course
i
have
said
yes
vulnerable
greenlandic
children
and
adolescents
must
have
a
better
everyday
life
and
a
hope
for
the
future
never
before
has
the
youth
of
greenland
been
that
much
needed
as
representatives
of
a
beautiful
and
lovely
country
a
country
which
can
show
the
entire
world
what
it
is
like
to
live
on
the
frontline
of
the
climate
crisis
we
must
show
our
children
that
we
take
the
climate
crisis
and
the
challenges
of
the
green
transition
seriously
if
we
cannot
solve
the
problems
which
the
young
generation
has
asked
us
to
solve
then
we
will
not
only
be
letting
down
the
young
people
then
we
will
betray
the
faith
in
the
future
if
we
those
of
us
who
have
the
opportunity
step
away
from
our
responsibility
then
we
will
be
feeding
powerlessness
instead
we
need
to
take
upon
us
the
responsibility
of
hope
and
the
will
to
act
the
challenge
is
enormous
the
ice
is
melting
storms
hurricanes
it
can
seem
insurmountable
and
distant
but
you
know
what
not
only
are
the
climate
changes
progressing
quickly
we
are
also
beginning
to
see
a
will
to
do
something
about
them
moving
at
a
greater
pace
in
all
parts
of
the
world
there
is
a
massive
interest
in
denmark
ambitions
the
climate
battle
can
become
a
common
danish
battle
children
and
adolescents
demand
change
now
we
must
deliver
the
corporations
denmark
has
the
worlds
best
green
corporations
and
now
we
need
the
rest
of
the
business
world
to
follow
agriculture
industry
transportation
maritime
businesses
all
the
big
business
areas
committing
partnerships
the
business
world
has
agreed
to
that
already
retirement
funds
who
manage
the
money
we
will
be
living
off
in
the
future
it
makes
sense
that
they
invest
the
money
so
that
we
may
actually
have
a
future
and
they
do
the
retirement
funds
secure
breath
taking
sums
billions
for
green
investments
the
politicians
we
here
in
this
hall
for
decades
the
green
transition
has
been
driven
forward
by
legislation
from
christiansborg
wind
turbines
ecology
energy
efficiency
now
others
the
young
people
the
businesses
are
way
ahead
of
us
we
need
to
get
back
in
front
the
government
has
together
with
de
radikale
sf
and
enhedslisten
set
a
historic
goal
by
2030
we
want
to
reduce
the
emission
of
greenhouse
gas
by
70
percent
alternativet
the
alternative
was
the
first
now
more
and
more
parties
are
getting
behind
that
goal
the
conservatives
dansk
folkeparti
the
danish
peoples
party
the
liberal
alliance
it
looks
promising
in
terms
of
the
green
cooperation
we
must
have
the
climate
legislation
ready
before
christmas
and
then
a
climate
action
plan
the
danish
economy
is
based
on
good
workplaces
and
important
export
activities
it
is
a
result
of
visionary
businesses
and
competent
employees
but
it
is
also
a
result
of
active
political
decisions
where
we
have
had
the
courage
to
bet
on
danish
positions
of
strength
today
we
export
billions
worth
of
environmental
water
energy
and
climate
technology
and
the
danish
pharmaceutical
industry
is
in
a
leading
position
worldwide
but
for
a
number
of
years
we
have
seen
budget
cuts
within
education
and
research
this
has
not
been
economically
responsible
we
need
to
refocus
the
economic
policies
the
government
will
be
spending
an
additional
billion
kroners
on
green
research
and
to
me
this
is
not
only
about
the
environment
but
also
about
our
nature
and
environment
we
need
a
clean
environment
an
air
quality
which
allows
us
to
breathe
freely
clean
drinking
water
forests
and
oceans
that
is
quality
of
life
just
think
of
today
october
1st
going
for
a
walk
in
the
woods
with
family
and
friends
is
there
anything
better
we
have
to
plant
more
trees
take
care
of
our
wildlife
stop
plastic
pollution
this
summer
a
deer
was
found
in
himmerland
with
four
kilos
of
plastic
in
its
stomach
four
kilos
and
it
is
not
only
deer
who
eat
plastic
waste
so
do
birds
so
do
fish
what
kind
of
a
world
is
this
let
us
enter
into
the
only
right
contract
between
generations
that
we
leave
a
nature
for
the
next
generation
to
take
over
which
is
in
a
better
shape
than
the
one
we
were
given
ourselves
we
need
to
live
up
to
the
trust
that
our
children
are
placing
in
us
in
terms
of
the
climate
and
all
of
the
green
agenda
have
great
ambitions
with
an
eye
on
jobs
and
economic
growth
in
respect
of
our
society
model
without
inequality
increases
that
is
what
we
can
do
with
a
new
government
a
new
majority
we
can
make
changes
a
greener
future
put
welfare
first
a
new
trust
in
the
fact
that
the
community
works
that
the
police
will
come
when
we
need
them
that
the
home
care
has
the
time
when
we
need
his
or
her
help
that
parents
can
bring
their
child
into
daycare
without
having
to
worry
all
the
way
through
the
working
day
is
it
good
enough
is
it
safe
enough
the
tax
authorities
must
work
and
those
who
have
been
worn
out
must
have
better
retirement
possibilities
a
tight
immigration
policy
but
without
the
symbolics
that
are
actually
more
about
politicians
than
about
solutions
we
did
not
build
denmark
on
dissent
inequality
or
greed
we
built
denmark
on
the
opposite
caregiving
trust
community
solidarity
enthusiasm
and
cooperation
we
must
strengthen
that
which
makes
denmark
into
denmark
i
look
forward
to
the
cooperation
with
everyone
here
at
the
folketing
we
must
honour
the
promise
we
have
created
a
more
safe
a
more
just
a
greener
denmark
long
live
denmark
hooray
hooray
hooray
